In this experiment we will present blocks of visual stimuli. Stimli will presented one at a time in the center of the screen.  Your task is to press the corresponding key to the matching stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible after each presentation.

We will now begin by viewing each of stimuli. Welcome to ask experimentor any question if not.

Press any key to continue....
