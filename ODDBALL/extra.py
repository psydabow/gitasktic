Version: 2019.02.0

The ppc module (ppc is short for "PsychoPy Course) contain some useful
methods to help you build and verify your experiment. Put the ppc.py
in the same folder as your script or in your PYTHONPATH. See these
functions in use in the ppc3_template.py and in ppc2_timing.py.

TO DO:
 * add UTC times in csvWriter?
 * Remove sound or make it a dummy-one which drops back to psychopy
 * Use PEP8 names instead of camelCase
